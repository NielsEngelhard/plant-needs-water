### What is it?

This - small - project is small and can be deployed in less than a day. The whole idea of the project
is to water plants with an arduino. The project has two main features. 1: Automatically water a plant
by measuring the dryness of the ground. 2: manually watering the plant with something like a button.

The code in the project is meant to be self explaining. A lot of information is present in the comments
of the code. The code consist of multiple files. Each file represent a concept of thinking or a
hardware component.

Good luck :)

### Limitations

For now, the project only supports 1 plant per arduino. There is another project running 
which can handle multiple plants.
